A discord bot intended for a group of friends. Very easy to setup for your personal server as well

Features these so far,

        Help function to see all commands
        Blackjack
        Roulette
        Fake Stock Market
        A Wheel to time someone out for a random duration
        Lottery system
        Daily points
        Commands to run every so often for points
        Role Authenticated admin commands
        Tracking of users various information 


For setup heres an example config.json
{
    "token": "1111",
    "guild_id": "5111",
    "target_member_id": "1111"
}

Token is your bots token, guild_id is the servers id, target_member_id is the target of the notifs commands. 

With config everything else should autogenerate on startup. (May have messed things up here and there.)
